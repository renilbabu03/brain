When troubled, men do not want their partner to express concern for them. Instead, men want to hear the problem at hand is within their abilities. They wish to sort the issue out themselves. Sympathy will only feel like the woman is undermining the man’s abilities.

When women are troubled, they love their partner to express concern for them. Women don’t like to hear the issue is simple. Describing her problems as simple rejects her concerns. A man should only propose a solution when he has considered all her feelings.

Women generally wants us to worry for her when they are upset. Not understanding this makes them more upset.
