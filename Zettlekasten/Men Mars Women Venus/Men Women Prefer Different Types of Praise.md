Men generally prefer to work on their own. They perceive assistance as an attempt to undermine their capabilities. They exercise their ability to solve problems quickly and love to have these abilities recognized and appreciated. Men also hate to have their skills ignored or mocked. They rarely use feelings to guide their behavior, as they believe this produces unreliable results


Women are different. Women prefer to co-operate and mostly avoid working on their own where possible. To women, others working independently undermine the teamâ€™s efforts to work interactively. Women believe abilities are generally unimportant, as they result in aggressive competitiveness. Instead, women exercise their feelings by interacting with other women.

Men desire appreciation of their abilities. Women desire appreciation for their assistance.
