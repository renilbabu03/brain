Men enjoy proving their worth by doing things, but they wait to be asked and struggle to remember to offer their services. So, women must learn to control their expectations. Men will not always expect women’s needs. Women should ask for help when they need it but avoid making it sound like a demand.


Men often interpret questions that begin with the words ‘Could you’ or ‘Can you’ as questioning their abilities. So, they respond more positively to the same questions if they begin instead with ‘Would you’ or ‘Will you’.


It is best to allow a man to do things in a way and at a time that works for him. If a man complains about a request, this is a good thing. It means he is considering doing it, and the best approach is to wait for him to decide.
