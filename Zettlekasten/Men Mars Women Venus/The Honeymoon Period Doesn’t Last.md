> When men and women are able to respect and accept their differences then love has a chance to blossom.


Love inevitably changes over time. The honeymoon period wonâ€™t last forever, and we all have flaws that will make relationships complicated. That said, understanding the other sex means we can sustainably love each other at a healthier and longer level. To achieve this, we must accept our partner is different from us and adapt accordingly.
