Men talk in a very literal way. Their primary purpose is to provide information, so they generally like to sort out their thoughts before communicating. Non-communication can arise, as men want to spend time alone considering their thoughts. Men must reassure women that they are merely taking time to think.


Women tend to use language more dramatically and artistically. This allows women to express their feelings fully. Women sort their thoughts out while communicating them. While providing this stream of concerns, women must reassure their partners that they are capable of caring for them.
