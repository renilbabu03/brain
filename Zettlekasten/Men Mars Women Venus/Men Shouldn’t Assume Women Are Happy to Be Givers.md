Men value results while women value thought. Issues can arise from this difference in values.

If men do not receive what they want, they may suspend giving. Women will continue to give even though they believe they are giving more. However, the woman will start to feel unloved, unappreciated, and resentful.

There are a few things that men and women can do to overcome these differences. Men should try to identify little ways to show they value their partner without being asked to do so. Men should also avoid the mistake of assuming their partner is happy to give without receiving anything back.

On the flip side, women should avoid pretending that they are happy with the inequality of giving. If women start to feel resentful, they should start to slowly reduce their giving and learn to ask for things in return. Women should also provide remarks of appreciation when their partner does something loving. These remarks will encourage their partner.
