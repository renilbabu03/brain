Women periodically sink into a depression when they feel they need to express their emotions. These emotions can stem from recent or long-standing problems and can build up over time. If they cannot find any real troubles, women might still find other worries. When women feel like this, they will no longer be givers. They will demand the right to express their feelings. If supported and given time to express their feelings, women will recover and soon return to their usual selves. As men spring between unhappiness and happiness, women’s gradual movements in mood may be hard for men to understand.

Women must assist their partners by not showing too much concern when they are sinking into their depression. Women should explain to their partners that it is not their fault.

Issues can arise when a man’s periodic need to be free coincides with a woman’s periodic need to be heard. At this point, the woman should share her concerns with her friends instead.
