One of the biggest flaws of men is their inability to pay sufficient attention to women’s feelings during an argument. One of the most significant flaws of women is being overly critical of men. Either of these flaws can be the trigger for an argument. These flaws can also trigger the partner’s flaws to arise, which further aggravates the argument. When men make mistakes, they become frustrated and angry. During this time, women should leave their partners alone to calm down.

Apologies are also considered differently by different sexes. Men consider apologies to be admissions of guilt. **Women consider apologies to be expressions of compassion**. This difference leads to issues, as men are much less willing to apologize.

Within arguments, the tone is often different between the sexes. Men generally use aggressive words to ensure that they win the argument. Women back down during arguments as they don’t want to engage with these aggressive words.

Men and women also adopt different approaches in attempts to avoid arguments. To avoid arguments, men will withdraw and refuse to talk. Women will pretend the disagreement is forgotten and will move on. The peace is a cold one, though, and the issues will remain. So, men should listen without getting defensive and women should try to express their feelings without being critical.
