Men run away from situations when they feel their self-sufficiency is threatened. Men can then become unapproachable. This temperamental behavior can be challenging for women.

Like rubber bands, men snap back into their natural state if given time. So, women should give men some time.

Men must also give women assurance that they will soon return to their usual happiness.


> [!Men will return with more love]
> If a man needs to pull away like a rubber band, when he returns he will be back with a lot more love. Then he can listen. This is the best time to initiate conversation.
