To avoid pain and fear, men tend to show anger and ego. They do this because they are always in pursuit of success.

> Man's deepest fear that he is not good enough or that he is incompetent. He compensates by focusing on increasing his power and competence. Success and Achievement are formost in his life.

To avoid these same feelings, women can lapse into depression.


Constructive communication is a critical skill to learn. To engage with this communication, we must also unlearn the repression of negative feelings. One way to do this is to write your feelings down. Writing your feelings down allows you to express your negative emotions in a controlled manner, rather than letting them explode. After this, you will be in a better position to explain yourself calmly.
