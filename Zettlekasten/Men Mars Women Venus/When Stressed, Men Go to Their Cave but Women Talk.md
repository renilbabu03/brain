When faced with a difficult problem, the typical reaction for men is to become non-communicative and withdraw temporarily to their “cave”. Most often, they go to their garage or spend time with their friends. They will probably not focus on solving the problem they’re facing during this time. The “time-out” allows them to distance themselves from the problem, relax, recharge and re-examine it later from a fresh angle.

Men take this approach because they hope to solve problems by themselves. They do not want interference from others. If men communicate, it is so that they can get the point across quickly. They generally avoid listening where possible.

When women become unduly stressed, their natural reaction is to talk to someone close about it, even if talking doesn’t provide a solution to the problem at hand. This sets up a natural dynamic where the man retreats as the woman tries to get closer, which becomes a major source of conflict.
