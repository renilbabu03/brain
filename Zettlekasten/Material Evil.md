Lets say your child wishes for an Iphone. He must have gone through a lot of emotional things. Its just too emotional, we could make a movie out of it. I once saw a fruit vendor looking at my bike ( mid range ) and his eyes were glowing with desire but I know its just not worth it. Even a movie is made out of my son , an emotional one. Lets say I bring him iphone. The most happy he would be at the time of receiving it. He would discard it after some time. So the point is, our desire of material things makes us emotional. I want a house, I want a Car, I want a good scooter. Keep material out of emotional boundary and only keep them in functional space. You will be much better. Because once you give your child the Iphone, lets say you worked your shit to buy , he is not going to appreciate it anyway. Humans are ungrateful, forgetful. No matter what we do to our loved ones, it happens they forget. Its an unworthy pursuit. A pursuit for disappointment. Its better to do it for the sake of Allah. Allah is grateful. Whatever you do for him is appreciated. Make your child earn what he wants and don't give your child an easy path to material stuffs. You just going to spoil them.
