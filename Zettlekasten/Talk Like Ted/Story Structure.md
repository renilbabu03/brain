Structure your story with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Your beginning should establish the setting and characters, the middle should introduce a challenge or conflict, and the end should bring resolution. Each of these segments should build towards its own mini-climax, keeping the audience hooked throughout the narrative. Instead of stating facts or describing events, paint a picture with your words. Use sensory details to make your story come alive. Make your audience see the characters, hear the sounds, and feel the emotions.

Practice your talk. Record. Analyse.
