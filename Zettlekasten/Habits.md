Habits can be formed by repetition and reward. We need to form a ritual to do the habit. Rituals are very important. A chef has a ritual of readying things before making. Baseball guys have rituals before batting. Cricketers have it too. 

So to break a bad Habits just form a ritual and then be mindful. Too much resistance is bad. Too much resistance is only going to make "Missing out" feeling which leads to binge out. The cycle repeats. But instead, we could allow ourself to indulge in the bad habit but by having a ritual, a repetition and being mindful of the behavior. 

So Steps are : 
 Let go Don't Push Don't Resist => Have a ritual => Have a repetition thing => Be Mindful by being curious => Journal Your thoughts
